## Users

Developer-fluent engineers who reach for IDs routinely: seeding databases, constructing test
fixtures, wiring API contracts, minting tokens and short URLs, generating IDs during prototyping.
They shop by ID strategy (random vs sortable vs compact), know what v4 vs v7 means, work primarily
from the keyboard, and return dozens of times a week. The tool earns trust by disappearing into
the task.

## Product Purpose

idlab removes every marginal step between "I need an ID" and having it ready. Organised by ID
family (UUID, ULID, NanoID), it generates batches (UUID v1/v3/v4/v5/v6/v7 plus nil/max, 1–200
entries; ULID; NanoID) with formatting options, validates and decodes existing UUIDs and ULIDs,
converts between representations (including ULID↔UUIDv7), and exposes every action via keyboard
shortcut. UUID is the anchor; the structure has room for more families (KSUID, Snowflake). Success
means a developer never opens another tab for an ID.

## Brand Personality

Terminal-luxury. Precise. Calm. Expert. The tool has confident opinions — dark-native,
monospace-first, one accent at a time — and does not explain itself. It earns authority by
being exactly right, not by performing effort.

## Anti-references

- **SaaS dashboard grey**: blue-tinted surfaces, sidebar navigation chrome, generic card grids,
  feature-overview decoration inside a task tool
- **Flashy developer marketing**: gradient-heavy dark modes, neon accent stacking, glassmorphism
  as decoration, oversaturated hero sections
- **Bare-bones utility**: no effort in UX, raw unstyled output, zero considered affordances,
  Hacker News aesthetic

## Design Principles

1. **Earn every pixel.** Real estate is leased to content (UUIDs, controls, status), not
   ornamentation. Borders are 1px hairlines. Decoration earns its place or doesn't appear.
2. **One accent at a time.** A single hue carries focus, active state, glow, and CTA. Never
   stack accents; the rarity of the accent is structural, not stylistic.
3. **The keyboard is the primary input.** Every action has a shortcut. Hover affordances are
   hints. The status bar advertises the shortcut overlay.
4. **Motion as feedback, not decoration.** Hover swaps in 120 ms, modals settle in 220 ms,
   regenerate spins for ~380 ms. No springs, no bounces, no page-load choreography.
5. **Consistency over surprise.** Same button shape, same form vocabulary, same icon style
   across all screens. Delight lives in micro-interactions; layout invention is not delight.

## Accessibility & Inclusion

WCAG AA throughout. All four accent palettes pass AA against their on-accent text values.
`--ink-4` (oklch ~0.40 in dark) is the dimmest legible token; never use it for actionable copy.
Color is never the sole carrier of state (active rows have a left bar and pip glyph alongside
accent tinting). Real `<input>` elements underpin all custom controls. `prefers-reduced-motion`
respected with instant state-swap alternatives.
