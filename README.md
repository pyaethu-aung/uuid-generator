# idlab: ID workbench

A keyboard-first ID workbench built with React 19 and Vite, organised by ID family. **UUID** is the anchor (generate v1/v3/v4/v5/v6/v7 plus nil/max, validate and decode, convert between representations), with **ULID** and **NanoID** alongside it. Generate, validate, decode, convert, and copy or download results without leaving the keyboard.

The top bar selects an ID family (UUID / ULID / NanoID); within UUID a mode switcher picks the operation (Generate / Validate / Convert). The canonical routes are `/uuid/generate`, `/uuid/validate`, `/uuid/convert`, `/ulid`, and `/nanoid`; the old `/generator`, `/validator`, `/converter`, and `/bulk` links redirect to their new homes.

## Feature Highlights
- Unified slider that drives both the on-screen preview count (capped at 20) and the downloadable batch size (1–200).
- Version selector covering v1, v3, v4, v5, v6, v7, nil, and max via the `uuid` npm package. v3/v5 are deterministic (namespace + name); v6 is the index-friendly field-reordered rewrite of v1.
- Pinned timestamp for the time-based versions (v1, v6, v7): switch from live "now" to a chosen moment to mint UUIDs for that instant, with a readout echoing the epoch milliseconds and decoded UTC. Useful for testing time-ordered ID systems; the inverse of the validator's timestamp decode.
- Validator tab handles one UUID or many: paste a single value or a list (one per line), or upload a `.txt` / `.csv` file — select multiple files to merge their contents. Every entry becomes a row in a triage table of status, version, variant, and timestamp, with a valid/invalid/total summary and one-click copy of every valid UUID. Click any row to expand the full inspector inline (parsed structure, properties, timestamp decode, and the v1↔v6 counterpart) — a lone UUID auto-expands. The retired `/bulk` deep link now lands here (`/uuid/validate`).
- ULID tab mints ULIDs (crypto-random, no dependency) and decodes a pasted ULID into its timestamp, randomness, and equivalent UUID forms. Accepts a UUIDv7 in the same field to convert the other way, since ULID and UUIDv7 share the 48-bit millisecond timestamp.
- NanoID tab generates batches of compact, URL-safe NanoIDs (crypto-random, no dependency) with an adjustable length (2–36) and alphabet preset (url-safe, alphanumeric, lowercase, hex, numbers); a live entropy readout reports the bit strength and the id count needed for a 1% collision chance.
- Copy as code: for the selected UUID version, the Generator shows how to mint it in JavaScript, Python, Go, Java, and SQL. Toggle between `inline` (the compact import + call one-liner) and `full` (a complete, copy-paste-runnable program with imports and output); both the displayed code and the copied text follow the toggle.
- Copy-to-clipboard with micro-interaction feedback plus a timestamped download action guarded against oversized files.
- Insight cards summarizing current options (version, batch size, characters per UUID) placed directly above the list for quick scanning.
- Responsive layout with gradients, keyboard-friendly control handling, and pointer event throttling to avoid jank.

- Esc — Close the shortcut reference overlay.

**UUID Generate**
- ⌘/Ctrl + Enter — Regenerate the latest UUID batch.
- ⌥/Alt + Arrow Up/Down — Adjust batch size (hold Shift for ±10).
- ⌥/Alt + 1 … 8 — Switch generators: v4, v1, v6, v7, v3, v5, nil, max.
- ⌥/Alt + U / H / B — Toggle uppercase, remove hyphens, wrap braces.

- ⌥/Alt + S — Copy the JavaScript code snippet for this version.
- ⌘/Ctrl + Alt + S — Download the batch in the selected export format.
- ⌘/Ctrl + Shift + C — Copy the first UUID in the batch.
- ⌥/Alt + Shift + C — Copy the whole visible batch.

**UUID Validate**
- ⌥/Alt + R / [ / − — Toggle strict RFC validation, allow braces, allow no-hyphens.
- ⌥/Alt + Backspace — Clear the input.

**UUID Convert / ULID**
- ⌥/Alt + Backspace — Clear the input.

**ULID / NanoID**
- ⌘/Ctrl + Enter — Mint a new ULID / fresh batch of NanoIDs.
- ⌥/Alt + Shift + C — (NanoID) Copy the whole batch.

## Getting Started
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`
3. Open `http://localhost:5173` (or the URL printed in the terminal) to interact with the UI.

## Tech Stack
- React 19 + Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- `uuid` npm package
- Clipboard and File APIs

## Design System

All design tokens — colour, typography, spacing, radius, and motion — live in `src/design-system/`:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `tokens.json` | Token definitions in W3C Design Token format |
| `tokens.css` | CSS custom properties consumed by the app |
| `Design System.html` | Living reference page; open directly in a browser |

`src/index.css` imports `tokens.css` as the single source of truth for all design values. To browse every token rendered visually, open `src/design-system/Design System.html` in a browser — it links to `tokens.css` automatically.

## Contributing

### End-to-end Testing with Playwright

Before opening a pull request, verify the UI using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev):

```bash
npx playwright install        # first time only — installs browser binaries
npx playwright test           # run all E2E tests headlessly
npx playwright test --ui      # interactive test runner with time-travel
```

Key flows to cover:

- **Keyboard shortcuts** — regenerate, copy, download, batch size, version switch, formatting toggles
- **Clipboard & download** — copy feedback, `.txt` file output with correct row count
- **Theme switching** — dark ↔ light, persistence across reload
- **Responsive layout** — workbench collapse at the 920 px breakpoint

### Design Snapshot Testing

[`pixelmatch`](https://github.com/mapbox/pixelmatch) and [`pngjs`](https://github.com/lukeapage/pngjs)
are installed as dev dependencies to enable pixel-level visual diffing between design
snapshots and the live app.

Snapshots are captured by the `/test-design` skill and saved to `.test-design/diffs/`.
On subsequent runs, pixelmatch compares the fresh screenshot against the saved baseline
and reports any pixel-level divergence.

## Security & Maintenance

### Automated Dependency Updates
This project uses **GitHub Dependabot** to automatically detect vulnerable dependencies and create pull requests to fix them.

- **Configuration**: Managed via `.github/dependabot.yml`.
- **Schedule**: Scans run daily.
- **PR Limits**: Maximum 10 open security PRs at a time to prevent alert fatigue (Best Practice: [Dependabot Security Config](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-security-updates/configuring-dependabot-security-updates)).
- **Review Policy**: **Manual review is required** for all security updates. Auto-merge is strictly disabled to ensure human oversight.
- **Notifications**: Alerts are sent via GitHub's native notification system (Web/Email). Ensure you are "Watching" the repository to receive them.

## Docker Support

Production-ready Docker support is available with optimized multi-stage builds and security hardening. Images are multi-platform (`linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`).

### Pull from GHCR
```bash
# Pull the latest published version (e.g. v1.0.0 → tag 1.0.0)
docker pull ghcr.io/pyaethu-aung/idlab:1.0.0

# Run on port 8080
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name idlab-app ghcr.io/pyaethu-aung/idlab:1.0.0
```

### Build Locally
```bash
# Build locally
npm run docker:build

# Run locally (port 8080)
npm run docker:run
```

### CI/CD Publishing
Images are published to GHCR **only on version tag pushes** (`v*.*.*`). Pushes to `main` and pull requests build and scan but do not publish. A daily scheduled Trivy scan runs to catch newly disclosed CVEs.

| Event            | Build | Trivy Scan | Push to Registry | Cosign Sign |
|------------------|-------|------------|------------------|-------------|
| Push to `main`   | ✅    | ✅         | ❌               | ❌          |
| Pull request     | ✅    | ✅         | ❌               | ❌          |
| Tag `v*.*.*`     | ✅    | ✅         | ✅               | ✅          |
