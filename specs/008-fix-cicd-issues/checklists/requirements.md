# Specification Quality Checklist: Fix CI/CD Workflow Issues

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-24
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass. Spec is ready for `/speckit.plan`.
- Scope is tightly bounded: GitHub Actions YAML changes only — no application code, Dockerfile content, or test logic.
- Five issues mapped to four user stories (US4 covers both the tag-trigger fix and the ESLint path filter removal from docker-publish.yml; the tag trigger fix is US1).
- No clarification questions needed — the problem description was precise and self-contained.
