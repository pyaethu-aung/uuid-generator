# Specification Quality Checklist: Simplify Visual Design

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-02-15  
**Feature**: [spec.md](file:///Users/pyaethuaung/go/src/github.com/pyaethu-aung/uuid-generator/specs/004-simplify-visual-design/spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass validation.
- The feature is a simplification/removal feature — scope is well-bounded by the specific elements to be removed.
- **Updated 2026-02-15**: Scope expanded to include removal of UI component gradients (CTA button `--gradient-cta`). Shadows are preserved.
- Ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
